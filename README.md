# NUTRIAPI

## Description

NutriAPI is a project designed to provide easy access to comprehensive nutritional information for food porducts available in Argentina. With a mission to promote healthy food habits and awareness among consumers, this open-source API addresses a persisting issue: the lack of nutritional information in the main food distribution chains in Argentina.

### Purpose 

The primary purpose of this project is to be able to provide customers in Argentina the knowledge they need to make informed and healthier food choices. By offering a simple, public and open-soure API, this project aims to contribute to the well-being of individuals in Argentina.

### Goals

- Accessibility: Ensure that nutritional information for a wide range of products is readily available for consumers.

- Collaboration: Foster collaboration with food distribution chains in Argentina to encourage the inclusion of nutritional facts on their websites, enhancing transparency and consumers trust.

- Education: Educate consumers about the nutritional content of food items, enabling them to make healthier dietary decisions.

# Roadmap

We have ambitious plans for the future of the Argentina Nutritional Facts API. Our goal is to continually enhance the user experience and expand the reach and impact of this project. Here are some key milestones and improvements we have in mind:

1. Frond-End Development: After the initial API launch, we plan to develop a user-friendly and visually appealing front-end interface. This will make it even easier for users to access and interact with the nutritional information.
2. Nomralization of Nutritional Data: We recognize the importance of standardizing the nutritional data for ease of comparison. We intend to normalize the "cantidad" column to represent servings of 100g, ensuring consistency across all products. This will also involve adjusting the values for fat, carbs, and protein accordingly.
3. Collaboration with Food Distribution Chains: Our ultimate goal is to collaborate with food distribution chains operating in Argentina. We will reach out to these chains to encourage them to include the nutrition fact table on their websites. This partnership will provide consumers with reliable information directly from the source, further promoting healthy food choices.
4. Enhancements Based on User Feedback: We value the input of our users. We will actively seek feedback and suggestions from the community and consider implementing new features and improvements based on their needs.
5. Data Expansion: We plan to expand our database to cover an even broader range of products available in Argentina. This includes adding new products, brands, and variations to ensure comprehensive coverage.
6. Mobile App: We are exploring the possibility of developing a mobile application to provide on-the-go access to nutritional information.
7. Community Building: We aim to build a strong and engaged community of users and contributors. Collaborative efforts will drive the project forward and ensure its long-term sustainability.
8. Code Enhancement: We are committed to improving the codebase of the API continuously. This includes optimizing performance, ensuring code maintainability, and following best practices in software development.

Our roadmap reflects our commitment to continuously improve and expand the NutriAPI. We invite you to join us on this journey and contribute to making healthy food choices more accessible to all. If you have suggestions or would like to get involved, please don't hesitate to reach out and share your ideas. Together, we can make a positive impact on the nutritional awareness.
